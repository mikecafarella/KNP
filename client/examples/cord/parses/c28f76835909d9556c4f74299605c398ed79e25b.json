The central and C-proximal regions of the polyprotein are cleaved by 3CL pro at 11 conserved sites, and the products are essential for viral replication (Thiel et al., 2001; Thiel et al., 2003; Ziebuhr et al., 2000) .

The first two domains show almost no differences and domain III shows slight structure deviation. However, the substrate lies in the cleft between the first two domains.

The main chain amides of G142 and A144 form an oxyanion hole that stabilizes the carbonyl oxygen of P1-Q. The main chain nitrogen atom of P1-Q forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain oxygen of Q163.

The side chains of these residues form a hydrophobic pocket that can accommodate a P2 residue with a large side chain, such as leucine or methionine (Fig. 5(A) ). The main chain of P3-V forms two hydrogen bonds with the main chain of E165, and the side chain of P3-V is exposed to the solvent (Fig. 5(A) ). Since the side chain of P3 Val is pointing to the surface and therefore to the solvent, the charged character of the P3 residue has no difference or preference.
