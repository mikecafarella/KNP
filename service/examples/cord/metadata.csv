This study added nasal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) probes for S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and respiratory viruses. Serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels were measured. Pathogens were identified in 78% of the patients. For detection of viruses, patients were randomized to either a 5-virus laboratory-generated PCR bundle or the 17-virus FilmArray PCR platform. The FilmArray PCR platform detected more viruses than the laboratory-generated bundle and did so in less than 2 hours. There were fewer days of antibiotic therapy, P = 0.003, in CAP patients with viral infections and a low serum PCT levels.",2015-08-05,"Gelfer, Gita; Leggett, James; Myers, Jillian; Wang, Luan; Gilbert, David N.",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/454a744cdd86def350e7ab253188aaef3833accd.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125660.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732889315002904; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0732889315002904; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2015.08.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26341706/,39527189

The gene for the SARS-CoV non-structural protein 10, which is located in the open reading frame of pp1a/pp1ab gene, was synthesized and used to screen for the specific cellular gene coding for the protein interacting with this nsp10 protein in a human embryo lung cDNA library using a yeast trap method. The results indicated that apart from the two subunits of cellular RNA polymerase complex, BTF3 and ATF5, this nsp10 protein was also able to interact specifically with the NADH 4L subunit and cytochrome oxidase II. Further study revealed that the activity of the NADH-cytochrome was altered and the inner mitochondrial membrane was depolarized in the transfected human embryo lung fibroblast by the nsp10 protein gene. The cytopathic effect of the Coronavirus 229E strain appeared more extensive in these cells than in the control cells.",2005-04-06,"Li, Qihan; Wang, Lichun; Dong, Chenghong; Che, Yanchun; Jiang, Li; Liu, Longding; Zhao, Hongling; Liao, Yun; Sheng, Yi; Dong, Shaozhong; Ma, Shaohui",J Clin Virol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/44efd15ada8c6e6a9de4017402163286a4b06905.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108382.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653205000715; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653205000715; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16157265/,28810530

A tool to facilitate rapid and accurate point-of-care (POC) differentiation is needed. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective, single center, blinded, observational clinical trial was conducted at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from December 2012 to August 2013 to determine the accuracy of a POC immunoassay to identify a clinically significant immune response to viral and/or bacterial infection. Sixty patients with acute febrile respiratory infection (19 pharyngitis and 41 lower respiratory tract infection [LRTI]) were enrolled. Participants provided fingerstick blood for immunoassay testing (myxovirus A [MxA] and c-reactive protein [CRP]) and four oropharyngeal samples for viral PCR and routine bacterial cell culture. A venous blood sample was collected. An ELISA was used to measure CRP and MxA. Paired serological testing was used to confirm atypical bacteria. A urine sample was provided for Streptococcus and Legionella antigen testing. Patients with suspected LRTI had sputum and blood cultures, chest X-ray, and WBC count measured. Viral infection was confirmed if oropharyngeal PCR was positive for viral pathogens. Bacterial infection was confirmed in positive throat or sputum cultures. Elevated immunoglobulin M antibodies or twofold increase in IgG antibodies between acute and convalescent phase indicated atypical bacteria. Positive Streptococcus or Legionella urine antigen assays also confirmed bacterial infection. The immunoassay correctly categorized subjects as 92% (22/24) negative, 80% (16/20) with bacterial infection, and 70% (7/10) with viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: The interplay between an MxA value and a semi-quantitative CRP value can aid in the differentiation of infectious etiology. In isolation, neither MxA nor CRP alone is sensitive or specific. However, the pattern of results in a rapid immunoassay provides a sensitive and specific method to differentiate acute febrile respiratory infections. This diagnostic information may help reduce antibiotic misuse and resistance and lower healthcare costs.",2015-12-10,"Sambursky, Robert; Shapiro, Nathan",Eur Clin Respir J,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/b4e98770894089e276f91c1d00e58c8885708e11.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4676840.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3402/ecrj.v2.28245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26672961/,6512213

Coronavirus 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)), which is involved in the processing of viral polyproteins for viral replication, is an appealing antiviral drug target. Here, we present the crystal structures of PEDV 3CL(pro) and a molecular complex between an inactive PEDV 3CL(pro) variant C144A bound to a peptide substrate. Structural characterization, mutagenesis and biochemical analysis reveal the substrate-binding pockets and the residues that comprise the active site of PEDV 3CL(pro). The dimerization of PEDV 3CL(pro) is similar to that of other Alphacoronavirus 3CL(pro)s but has several differences from that of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) from the genus Betacoronavirus. Furthermore, the non-conserved motifs in the pockets cause different cleavage of substrate between PEDV and SARS-CoV 3CL(pro)s, which may provide new insights into the recognition of substrates by 3CL(pro)s in various coronavirus genera.",2016-04-26,"Ye, Gang; Deng, Feng; Shen, Zhou; Luo, Rui; Zhao, Ling; Xiao, Shaobo; Fu, Zhen F.; Peng, Guiqing",Virology,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c28f76835909d9556c4f74299605c398ed79e25b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111274.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2016.04.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27128350/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682216300769; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682216300769,39949361
