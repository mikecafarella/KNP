The main goal of the Knowledge Client is to allow users to quickly obtain a high-quality relation, on any topic. It is intended for integration into applications or data science workflows. The client obtains its data from the backing Universal Knowledge Collaboration Network . Users may have to consult the UKCN in order to find the right identifiers for data objects and properties. The current client is written in Python, though there is nothing Python-specific about it: future clients could be written to integrate with programs in Go, Rust, Swift, etc. Data Model A relation in both the Knowledge Client and the UKCN is akin to a traditional RDBMS relation: it's got rows and columns. However, our relations differ in two important ways: 1. Each row has a globally-unique identifier. This is roughly similar to the rowid that some database systems provide. However, our row ids are globally-unique identifiers. 2. Like a traditional RDBMS, each column has a human-understandable name (e.g., \"Salary\") and a type (e.g., \"float\"). In addition, in our system each column has a semantic label . These labels are drawn from a dictionary maintained by the UKCN . For example, a column might be annotated by a label /properties/wikidata/P3618 , which indicates \"base salary\". Execution Model The client allows the programmer to build a single relation at a time. The sequence of steps that the Knowledge Client performs can be thought of as a single \"table initialization step\", followed by a series of joins that grow the table's rows and columns. Some common kinds of initialization include: - Creating a table of a single row and a single column. For example, consider a single column that identifies a KG object, with a single row that represents the Barack Obama object. - Creating a table of many rows and a single column. For example, consider a single column that identifies a KG object, with multiple rows that represent members of a class, such as all instances of the City object. - Creating a table that corresponds to a pre-made table in the UKCN . For example, the programmer may grab a table of dollar-to-Euro exchange statistics. After initialization, the user performs a series of joins that potentially add rows and columns to the table. With some naming guidance from the user, the system synthesizes all of the appropriate column metadata for each new row and column. The system does not try to extract or clean UKCN data at the time of use, apart from a few important exceptions. At the individual fact level, everything the user sees inside a relation created by the Knowledge Client can be found in the UKCN . The exceptions surround cases when the system believes that facts in the UKCN are correct at the individual level, but will yield a relation that is internally inconsistent. Unfortunately, this is a well-known problem in knowledge graphs. Consider the example that Tim Berners-Lee is an example of Computer Scientist , while Computer Scientist is an example of profession . A Knowledge Client user trying to create a table of professions might inadvertently obtain one that includes Tim Berners-Lee . When appropriate, the Knowledge Client will either silently fix these issues, or will issue a warning to the user. Examples Let's try to show a few examples of using the Knowledge Client .

Like existing systems, it: - Hosts data - Contains entities and properties - Offers a range of query interfaces, such as SPARQL and the Knowledge Client - Hosts both well-known objects (e.g., Barack Obama) and obscure ones (e.g., a random uploaded image file) - Largely relies on social processes for data curation Unlike existing systems, the UKCN also models the computational world, with support for storing files, databases, schemas, execution events, functions, and other items. This allows the UKCN to apply the virtues of traditional knowledge graph systems --- topic flexibility and efficient curation --- to all the data that an application developer might need. Using the UKCN Like Wikidata, the UKCN presents an HTML browser interface for users. Anyone can search and retrieve data from the UKCN . With an account, a user can create new UKCN objects, annotate and edit existing ones, run functions, and carry out a range of other tasks. Every data object in the UKCN has its own URL. This URL can be used in the browser to find an object. The same URL can be provided to the Knowledge Client for various use cases. Sharing data with a colleague is as easy as sharing a webpage: just send your friend the appropriate URL. Every data object in the UKCN has an affiliated user account as its owner. In the current version of the UKCN , all data objects are world-readable and world-writable. Future versions will implement user permissions that prevent unauthorized access and edits. Data Model Data objects in UKCN are immutable: with one important exception, they can never change and are never deleted. Every immutable data object has an obscure identifier . This can be used to fetch the data object, forever. Because obscure identifers are never recycled, and because data objects can never be modified, UKCN can be used for long-term provenance tracking. An object with an obscure identifier is akin to a particular version of a particular entity in Wikidata; it might be useful and popular, but probably not. The UKCN also offers well-known identifiers . This is the only kind of value in the UKCN that can change over time. A well-known identifier starts with the letter 'X', followed by an integer. It is akin to the set of top-level entities in Wikidata, such as Q76 (Barack Obama). A well-known identifier always points to a single immutable data object (which, of course, also has an obscure identifier). This is similar to the way in which a high-level Wikidata identifier (e.g, Q76) at any moment in time points to a particular version of the entity. In practice, users can mostly ignore this distinction. Most people will mostly deal with well-known objects; that is, objects currently pointed-to by a well-known identifier . Non-well-known objects are generally only of interest when looking at past versions (e.g., for provenance tracking reasons). Users retrieving UKCN objects using a single query interface, whether its via an obscure identifier or a well-known identifier, Deployment There is a single UKCN that is implemented across multiple servers, in the same way there is a single World Wide Web implemented across multiple web servers. This will allow users and institutions to host data that might be tied to a particular location, while allowing users to ignore physical placement when annotating and curating data. However, the current UKCN software implements only \"single-server mode\". Interfaces The UKCN allows users to access it in three ways: 1. When building applications, via the Knowledge Client 2. When curating and sharing data, via the HTML Browser interface 3. When uploading novel data artifacts programmatically, via the REST API This last interface is primarily useful when integrating the UKCN with existing data pipelines.
