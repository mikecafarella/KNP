Claiming numerous safety precautions in his biosafety level 3 (BSL3\u03e9) laboratory, Fouchier calculates P 1 \u03ed 1 \u03eb 10 -7 per person per year, and since there are 10 workers with access to his laboratory, P 1 \u03ed 1 \u03eb 10 -6 per lab per year. Compare this to P 1 \u03ed 2 \u03eb 10 -3 per lab per year for BSL3 laboratories calculated from CDC statistics for undetected or unreported LAIs (2, 3), here called \"community LAIs,\" as it is assumed that an undetected or unreported LAI represents an infection that has traveled outside the lab and into the community.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 83, "end": 86, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Recently reported escapes of LAIs from high-level biocontainment at CDC laboratories (4) and the long history of LAIs and other escapes from laboratories (5) also argue that Fouchier's value for P 1 is too low.

It is not clear what this calculation tells us. Does it give us the elapsed time for a 10% chance that an LAI occurs? Does it give us elapsed time for a 50% chance, or an 80% chance? In this regard, the elapsed time for a 100% chance is infinite, as we can never be absolutely certain that an LAI will occur. I suggest attaching little weight to this elapsed time calculation and instead concentrating on risk \u03ed likelihood \u03eb consequences, starting with the P 1 probability, specifically: potential pandemic fatalities \u03ed (probability of a community LAI) \u03eb (probability that the community LAI leads to a pandemic) \u03eb (estimated fatalities in a pandemic).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "My risk calculation estimates the likelihood of a community LAI for both a single laboratory and n laboratories conducting this research over y years.

As I will soon show, E \u03ed 0.0003, or 0.03%, is not nearly small enough to reduce risk to an acceptable level.

If instead P 1 \u03ed 2 \u03eb 10 -4 or P 1 \u03ed 2 \u03eb 10 -3 is more representative of the real probability, then the fatalities and fatality burden for each lab in the enterprise would be much higher.
