Sixty patients with acute febrile respiratory infection (19 pharyngitis and 41 lower respiratory tract infection [LRTI]) were enrolled. Participants provided fingerstick blood for immunoassay testing (myxovirus A [MxA] and c-reactive protein [CRP]) and four oropharyngeal samples for viral PCR and routine bacterial cell culture. Avenous blood sample was collected. An ELISAwas used to measure CRP and MxA. Paired serological testing was used to confirm atypical bacteria. A urine sample was provided for Streptococcus and Legionella antigen testing. Patients with suspected LRTI had sputum and blood cultures, chest X-ray, and WBC count measured. Viral infection was confirmed if oropharyngeal PCR was positive for viral pathogens. Bacterial infection was confirmed in positive throat or sputum cultures. Elevated immunoglobulin M antibodies or twofold increase in IgG antibodies between acute and convalescent phase indicated atypical bacteria. Positive Streptococcus or Legionella urine antigen assays also confirmed bacterial infection. The immunoassay correctly categorized subjects as 92% (22/24) negative, 80% (16/20) with bacterial infection, and 70% (7/10) with viral infection. Conclusions: The interplay between an MxA value and a semi-quantitative CRP value can aid in the differentiation of infectious etiology.

In many of these indications, antibiotics are unlikely to provide clinical benefit to patients (1, 2) . The majority of antibiotics prescribed to adults in ambulatory practice in the United States can be attributed to the lack of clinically differentiating features (3, 4) .

In isolation, neither MxA nor CRP alone is sensitive or specific in identifying viral and/or bacterial infection. However, a multiplexed pattern of results consisting of the combined interpretation of low CRP, high CRP, and elevated levels of MxA may provide a sensitive and specific way to identify an immune response to a viral and/or bacterial infection. Use of a rapid test may result in lesser instances of unnecessary antibiotic use, reduce antibiotic resistance, and lower healthcare costs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "The immunoassay tested in this original investigation was developed by RPS Diagnostics (RPS) and was clinically evaluated in a feasibility trial at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (a Harvard Medical School teaching tertiary care hospital).
