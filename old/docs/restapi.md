# REST API

The [__UKCN__](sharingservice.md) offers a REST API for integration with existing data pipelines. This lets users and organizations who have data product jobs:
- Obtain source data for data pipeline inputs
- Upload new data pipeline outputs
- Upload metadata about the pipeline execution itself

## TODO: ##
Show examples of locally-running data production code.  How you grab data, how you make new data, and how you upload metadata to the service.  Try using the code that is in the COVID example.
